History
The Redeemed Christian Church of God, Glory 2 Glory House (Youth
Province 2, Magodo Centre) also referred to as RCCG G2G House was
birthed on Saturday October 30, 2010 by the Holiness Model Parish. Pastor
Adefela Odueyungbo was the Pastor in charge of the Holiness Area and
Holiness Model Parish at that time. The Parish was the first youth church in
Lagos Province 37 and had Pastor B.A. Ajaiyeoba as Pastor in charge of the
Province and Pastor Taiwo Adeleye fondly called PTA as the first Parish
Pastor.
RCCG G2G House relocated to her permanent site, her present location at 5,
Salami Olonode Street (formerly Samuel Olabode), Isheri – Magodo in the
first week of July 2014.
In August 2017, by the divine direction of the General Overseer of RCCG –
Pastor Enoch Adejare Adeboye, Youth Provinces were birthed. With this
development, G2G House was moved to the new Youth Province 2.
Worthy of note and commendation in the history of the Church are the
efforts and support of RCCG Homeland Missions Board, RCCG Region 11,
Pastor Charles Kpandei (Pastor in charge of Region 11), Pastor Olaitan
Olubiyi, Pastor B. A Ajaiyeoba, Pastor Magnus Maduka (Pastor in charge of
Lagos Province 64), Holiness Model Parish, Covenant Partners, Ministers
and Workers of the Parish.

Overseer, Young Adult &amp; Youth Affairs – Pastor Peter Amenkhienan,
Assistant General Overseer, Administration – Pastor J.F. Odesola, our
Regional Pastor – Pastor Charles Kpandei and Pastor in charge of Youth
